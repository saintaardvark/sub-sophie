# Sophie

Sophie is a [sub][0] with helpful commands for working on a Rocks
cluster.  It's stuff I use for work; thus the assumption that you're
using Torque and Maui, you have sudo access, and so on.  Some of it
may be specific to me, and I know it can be improved and expanded --
but it should be a good place to start.

See the [sub][0] page for installation instructions, and thanks to the
wonderful folks at 37signals for providing this in the first place.
